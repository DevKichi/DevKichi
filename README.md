## Hi there 👋

## 💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for both low-level systems and expressive web development.
I love blending clean code with a bit of character — writing performant code without losing the joy of good design.

# Currently learning:

Advanced C++ (data structures, algorithms, memory management)
Python async workflows, backend systems & AI
JavaScript fundamentals and Discord.js bot development


## Languages I use most:

🧩 C++ — for performance and control
🐍 Python — for backend, automation, quick prototyping and AI
⚡ JavaScript —  for scripting and Discord bot logic

## 🎌 Interests

Anime (magic academy, reincarnation plots, deep world-building & lore)
Well-structured codebases, algorithmic problem solving, and clean architecture
Building personal tools that actually get used

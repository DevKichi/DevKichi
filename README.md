## 💻 Who's DevKichi?

I'm a Computer Science student with a passion for both low-level systems and expressive web development.
I love blending clean code with a bit of character — writing performant code without losing the joy of good design.

# Currently learning:

- Advanced C++ (data structures, algorithms, memory management)
- Python async workflows, backend systems & AI
- JavaScript fundamentals and Discord.js bot development


## Languages I use most:

- 🧩 C++ — for performance and control
- 🐍 Python — for backend, automation, quick prototyping and AI
- ⚡ JavaScript —  for scripting and Discord bot logic

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

Here are some of the tools and technologies I use regularly:
